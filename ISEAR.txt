"%fear#I felt a physical fear, if I can call it this way, today, in the bus where  
I was sitting on the first seat. While turning the driver didn't  
see the tram which was making a dash towards us (coming from the  
side I was), and whose driver intended to cross in yellow

University. I was at home, the atmosphere was still, though I  
myself was full of suspense. I tried to do different things. When  
the telephone rang and...! Yes, of course there were other  
situations when I felt a similar feeling but I was unmindful of  
them.#%"

were brought to my knowledge later.#%"	
"%sadness#Sometimes, when I'm alone I am seized by this feeling. But it  
always helps me to come round and at the same time to judge if it  
is worth. Very often this feeling is caused to me by people -  
friends who I love and respect.#%"
